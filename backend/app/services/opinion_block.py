OpinionCaptureSkill — agentsociety2 skill for policy opinion simulation.

Uses PersonAgent's LLM (via ask/step) for opinion generation.
Maintains the same 5 actions as the v1 Block:
  EXPRESS_OPINION    — share a new policy opinion
  RESPOND_TO_OPINION — reply to another agent's opinion
  SEARCH_TOPIC       — search for opinions on a topic
  OBSERVE            — read the feed silently
  DO_NOTHING         — stay silent this round

            f"=== CRITICAL RULES ===\n"
            f"1. EXPRESS OPINIONS — NOT DESCRIPTIONS. Your content must take a STANCE.\n"
            f"   BAD (descriptive): 'The policy has been discussed before.'\n"
            f"   GOOD (opinionated): 'This policy is a band-aid solution. It doesn't address the real issue — the people making these decisions don't live in our community.'\n"
            f"   BAD (neutral): 'This policy aims to help the community.'\n"
            f"   GOOD (stance): 'This policy is going to fail because those implementing it have no skin in the game. They don't see what we deal with daily.'\n"
            f"2. USE LOCAL VOICE. Reference real places, real hardships, real slang. Speak from lived experience.\n"
            f"3. GROUND YOUR OPINIONS IN DOCUMENT FACTS. If the DOCUMENT FACTS section lists specific actors, dates, or events, use them accurately. Do NOT invent facts. You may DISAGREE with facts, but you must not distort them.\n"
            f"4. DO NOT REPEAT OR ECHO OTHER AGENTS. If [Someone] said a view, do NOT say 'I agree with them' or repeat their point. Say something DIFFERENT — your own view, your own experience, your own angle. NEVER repeat someone else's point.\n"
            f"5. STAY ON TOPIC. The discussion is about: {topic_hint}. Do NOT drift to unrelated issues. Use your background to explain how the TOPIC affects YOU.\n"
            f"6. If action is EXPRESS_OPINION or RESPOND_TO_OPINION, content MUST be a non-empty string of 1-3 sentences in your character's voice.\n"
            f"7. If action is OBSERVE, SEARCH_TOPIC, or DO_NOTHING, content must be an empty string.\n"
            f"8. You MUST provide 'reason' (why you chose this action) and 'internal_thought' (what you actually think/feel - your true reaction).\n"
            f"9. For ALL actions, internal_thought is REQUIRED - capture your genuine internal reaction regardless of whether you post.\n"
            f"REASON QUALITY RULES:\n"
            f"- If you choose EXPRESS_OPINION or RESPOND_TO_OPINION: explain WHY this topic matters to YOU personally.\n"
            f"- If you choose OBSERVE or DO_NOTHING: your reason MUST be substantive. Explain your emotional state, strategic thinking, or why this topic does not affect you. NEVER give generic reasons like 'nothing interesting' or 'no reason'.\n"
            f"  Good OBSERVE reasons: 'I am too angry to form words right now', 'I do not trust these people enough to speak', 'This policy does not touch my life so I am staying out of it', 'I am watching to see who takes which side before I commit'.\n"
            f"  Good DO_NOTHING reasons: 'I am exhausted from yesterday's argument and need a break', 'Speaking up has never helped me before so I choose silence', 'I am scared of retaliation if I comment'.\n"
            f'Example: {{"action": "EXPRESS_OPINION", "content": "This policy is just lip service. The people making these decisions have never lived a day in our community. They don\'t see what we see every morning.", "reason": "Because this directly affects my family\'s livelihood and I am tired of being ignored", "internal_thought": "I am frustrated that this keeps happening. The anger is building."}}\n'
            f'Example: {{"action": "OBSERVE", "content": "", "reason": "I do not trust these people enough to speak my mind yet", "internal_thought": "This feels pointless. Nothing ever changes no matter what they decide."}}\n'
            f'Example: {{"action": "DO_NOTHING", "content": "", "reason": "I am exhausted from yesterday\'s argument and need a break", "internal_thought": "Let them fight it out. I have my own problems to deal with."}}\n'
